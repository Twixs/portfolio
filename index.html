                    I am a Front-End Engineer with more than 1 year of programming experience, including Angular and
                    React frameworks.
                    I have a strong sense of aesthetics and interaction, good practical skills in the development of
                    responsive and progressive web apps.
                    My previous work as a Customer Support Engineer gave me valuable experience in such technologies as
                    Salesforce, Cloud Services, and SSMS.
                    In a team of 2 people, we closed all the support cases. In addition to the above, I have solid
                    communication skills and a great desire to discover new technologies.

                <h3>Charity Project for an orphanage</h3>
                <p>
                    The goal of this project was to create a website for the orphanage that contained the database with
                    children's information (name, age, short bio, and so on)
                    and their wishes. The idea was to provide an easy way for people to supply children with everything
                    they need. Moreover, you could find a list of events on the
                    website and donate.

                <h3>Pastry Platform</h3>
                <p>
                    During this project, a multi-sided platform was developed for bakers and pastry buyers. Bakers spent
                    a lot of time and money on creating content and advertising
                    their social media pages to find and attract new clients and communicate with them. On the other
                    hand, those who wanted to purchase pastry spent a lot of time on
                    finding a proper baker. The solution helped both sides to find each other faster and made the order
                    placement and purchasing easier, thus saving both time and money.
